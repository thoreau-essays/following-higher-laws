# Essay Content Folder

This folder contains your essay content as Markdown files with front matter.

## Creating Essays

Each essay is a Markdown file with YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Essay Title
order: 1
byline: Your Name (optional)
---

Your essay content in Markdown...
```

### Required Front Matter

- **`title`** - The essay's title (appears in navigation and page header)
- **`order`** - Numeric value controlling display order (1, 2, 3...)

### Optional Front Matter

- **`byline`** - Author attribution line
- **`featured-image`** - Header image specific to this essay

## File Naming

Name your essay files descriptively:

```
01-introduction.md
02-chapter-one.md
03-chapter-two.md
04-conclusion.md
```

The **filename determines the URL**, but the **`order` field controls navigation sequence**.

## Writing Workflow

1. **Create** a new `.md` file in this folder
2. **Add front matter** with title and order
3. **Write content** in Markdown
4. **Save** and preview locally with `bundle exec jekyll s`
5. **Push to GitHub** to publish

## Copy & Replace Strategy

**The demo essays in this folder show working examples of every feature.** To use a feature:

1. Find it in a demo essay
2. Copy the `{% include ... %}` code block
3. Paste into your essay
4. Replace the content with your own
5. Save and preview

## Order Tips

Use gaps in your order numbers for flexibility:

```yaml
order: 10  # Instead of 1
order: 20  # Instead of 2
order: 30  # Instead of 3
```

This makes it easy to insert essays later without renumbering everything.
